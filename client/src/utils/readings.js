There is no case known (neither, indeed, is it possible) in which a thing is found to be the efficient cause of itself; for so it would be prior to itself, which is impossible. Now in efficient causes it is not possible to go on to infinity, because in all efficient causes following in order, the first is the cause of the intermediate cause, and the intermediate is the cause of the ultimate cause … Now to take away the cause is to take away the effect. Therefore, if there be no first cause among efficient causes, there will be no ultimate, nor any intermediate, cause. But if in efficient causes it is possible to go on to infinity, there will be no first efficient cause, neither will there be an ultimate effect, nor any intermediate efficient causes; all of which is plainly false. Therefore it is necessary to admit a first cause, to which everyone gives the name of God.</div>

The standard model specifies numerous physical laws, but that's not all it does. According to the standard model there are roughly two dozen dimensionless constants that characterize fundamental physical quantities...<br/><br/>Physicists have determined the (approximate) values of the fundamental constants by measurement. (There's no way to derive the values of the fundamental constants from other aspects of the standard model. Any quantities that could be so derived wouldn't be fundamental.) Still, the underlying theory favored some sorts of parameter-values over others. ... Physicists made the startling discovery that –– given antecedently plausible assumptions about the nature of the physical world –– the probability that a universe with general laws like ours would be habitable was staggeringly low.<br/><br/> We thus focus on a package of three propositions: (i) the proposition that given the general laws, only a minute fraction of values of the cosmological constant (as judged by any of the physically-respectable measures) are life-permitting; (ii) the proposition that quasi-theism is false; and (iii) the proposition that physical reality consists of a single universe. We will call this \"the package.\" Our core argument is that if one supposes the package to be true, then theism is significantly more plausible than atheism. We are not claiming that we know that the package is true; we're just trying to figure out what its ... significance would be.&nbsp;<br/><br/>We should emphasize just how small we take the life- permitting parameter values to be according to the physically-respectable measures. “Small” here doesn’t mean “1 in 10,000” or “1 in 1,000,000”. It means the kind of fraction that one would resort to exponents to describe, as in “1 in 10 to the 120”. The kind of package that we have in mind tells us that only a fantastically small range is life permitting.&nbsp; <br/><br/> So ... how does atheism fare conditional on the package plus [the fact that life exists]? It is quite easy to make the case that it fares badly. The central thought is that the package plus life is fantastically unlikely conditional on atheism but not nearly as unlikely conditional on theism. Let's suppose that theism was not anything like fantastically unlikely to begin with. The result will be that, conditional on the package plus life, theism will be substantially more probable than atheism.</div>

        <div className='readingText'>The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. Humans beings have subjective experience: there is something it is like to be them. We can say that a being is conscious in this sense – or is phenomenally conscious, as it is sometimes put — when there is something it is like to be that being. A mental state is conscious when there is something it is like to be in that state. Conscious states include states of perceptual experience, bodily sensation, mental imagery, emotional experience, occurrent thought, and more. There is something it is like to see a vivid green, to feel a sharp pain, to visualize the Eiffel tower, to feel a deep regret, and to think that one is late. Each of these states has a phenomenal character, with phenomenal properties characterizing what it is like to be in the state.<br /><br />
            
            There is no question that experience is closely associated with physical processes in systems such as brains. It seems that physical processes give rise to experience, at least in the sense that producing a physical system (such as a brain) with the right physical properties inevitably yields corresponding states of experience. But how and why do physical processes give rise to experience? Why do not these processes take place 'in the dark,' without any accompanying states of experience? This is the central mystery of consciousness.<br /><br />
            
            ... it is conceivable that there be a system that is physically identical to a conscious being, but that lacks at least some of that being’s conscious states. Such a system might be a zombie: a system that is physically identical to a conscious being but that lacks consciousness entirely. It might also be an invert, with some of the original being’s experiences replaced by different experiences, or a partial zombie, with some experiences absent, or a combination thereof. These systems will look identical to a normal conscious being from the third-person perspective: in particular, their brain processes will be molecule-for-molecule identical with the original, and  their behavior will be indistinguishable. But things will be different from the first-person point of view. What it is like to be an invert or a partial zombie will differ from what it is like to be the original being. Andthere is nothing it is like to be a zombie. <br /><br />
            
            From the conceivability of zombies, proponents of the argument infer their possibility. ... zombies could have existed, perhaps in a very different sort of universe. For example, it is sometimes suggested that God could have created a zombie world, if he had so chosen. From here, it is inferred that consciousness must be nonphysical. If there is a ... possible universe that is physically identical to ours but that lacks consciousness, then consciousness must be a further, nonphysical component of our universe. If God could have created a zombie world, then ... after creating the physical processes in our world, he had to do more work to ensure that it contained consciousness.</div>

        <div className='readingText'>There are two ways of looking at our duty in the matter of opinion ... We must know the truth, and we must avoid error. These are are first and great commandments as would-be knowers; but they are not two ways of stating an identical commandment, they are two separable laws.<br/><br/>Clifford's exhortation has to my ears a thoroughly fantastic sound. It is like a general informing his soldiers that it is better to keep out of battle forever than to risk a single wound. Not so are victories either over enemies or over nature gained. Our errors are surely not such awful solemn things. In a world where we are so certain to incur them in spite of all our caution, a certain lightness of heart seems healthier than this excessive nervousness on their behalf.</div>

But here there is an infinity of happy life to be won, one chance of winning against a finite number of chances of losing, and what you are staking is finite. That leaves no choice; wherever there is infinity, and where there are not infinite chances of losing against that of winning, there is no room for hesitation, you must give everything. And thus, since you are obliged to play, you must be renouncing reason if you hoard your life rather than risk it for an infinite gain, just as likely to occur as a loss  amounting to nothing.</div>

            George is on a footbridge over the trolley tracks. He knows trolleys, and can see that the one approaching the bridge is out of control. On the track back of the bridge there are five people; the banks are so steep that they will not be able to get off the track in time. George knows that the only way to stop an out-of-control trolley is to drop a very heavy weight into its path. But the only available, sufficiently heavy weight is a fat man, also watching the trolley from the footbridge. George can shove the fat man onto the track in the path of the trolley, killing the fat man; or he can refrain from doing this, letting the five die.</div>
